# About Me:
*My name is Lari Rupp, and I am living in Oregon. I have spent most of my career as a "General Engineer", specializing in mechanical, electrical,  plumbing, and structural disciplines. I have a lifelong fascination with Data Science, so I am currently in the middle of a 6-month coding bootcamp for Python and a smattering of other Financial Technology softwares. My Linkedin inbox is always open to anyone who would like to collaborate!*

A `print` function in Python displays the text or variable passed in the function as output:

```python
text = ‘This is a sentence that you would like to display.’
print(text)
```
